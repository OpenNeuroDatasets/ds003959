This project investigates the application of a recently developed diffusion MRI technique, namely Soma and Neurite Density Imaging (SANDI), to characterize mouse brain tissue microstructure, both in white and gray matter, in-vivo. SANDI employs a multi-shell diffusion acquisition up to high b-values and a three-compartment model to disentangle the signal contribution from water diffusing in spherical objects (assumed to be associated with cell bodies) and in impermeable cylinders (representing neurites). 

The dataset consists of multi-shell diffusion MRI data from 6 wild type mice with 8 b-values: 1, 2.5, 4, 5.5, 7, 8.5, 10 and 12.5 ms/um2 with 40 directions per shell. 

Ses-1 provides the nifti files for the pre-processed magnitude data and ses-2 provides the nifti files for the pre-processed real data.
